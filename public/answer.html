<h1> He Loves Jade (JC) of Course!</h1>

        <p>JC Eyes is literally one of the most adventurous people around. She is always down for an impromptu trip or a thoroughly planned itinerary. No matter the adventure, she tackles it with a full heart and a great sense of humor. If you're lucky enough to go on a trip with her, I recommend you pay close attention to her radiant smile and her infectious giggle. </p>

        <img class="image" src="../assets/jade-muffin-2.png" alt="Jade and Muffin Dog">
        <p>This is JC with our wonderful pup named Muffin. JC is the best mom a dog could ask for. Trust Me! This dog eats better than we do some nights. It's totally worth it too. Muffin is the happiest dog I know. She has a beautiful shiny coat thanks to all the nutritional knowledge her mother puts into her food. They are truly a dynamic duo.</p>

        <p>Jade just looks amazing here! I love how the sun makes her eyes shine like deep pockets of honey. Her cheekbones are immaculate. It's probably why she gets compared to Victoria Justice so much. Sheâ€™s wearing makeup here, and it looks great, but she never needs it. She genuinely has the most naturally beautiful face I have ever seen. Look out, Cleopatra! I fear the legends of your looks don't hold a candle to this modern marvel. I feel grateful that I get to see it every day. </p>
